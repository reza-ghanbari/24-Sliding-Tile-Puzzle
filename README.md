This project is a replication of [Disjoint pattern database heuristics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370201000923) by Korf & Felner. The implementation solves 24-puzzle samples mentioned in the paper by implementing an IDA* algorithm using pattern databases as the heuristic. For more details, checkout report.pdf.
